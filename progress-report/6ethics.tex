As mentioned in the Project Specification, the project is only meant to be available for personnel within the University of Warwick. Furthermore, no human involvement is needed for the realisation of the project apart from students being exposed to the design as a result of participation in \textit{Evaluation Day}.

The legal issues that need to be considered are the similarities of the developed product and other existent hardware, as observed in Section \ref{sec:backgr} of the report. However, the project aims to create a standalone system and not build upon existent work. Any information that the design will make use of will be adequately referenced.

No other ethical concerns have surfaced in the development of the project as of the current date.
