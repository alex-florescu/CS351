# CS351 - FPGA Guitar Effects Project
https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/dcs/teaching/material/cs310/finding/projectsuggestions/registered_projects_2023-24.pdf

## Keep in mind:
  * start by talk about the problem that you are fixing!
  * set up meeting with supervisor, decide how. Don't show up to meetings with nothing to discuss
  * divide objectives into: core & extra, so that your work can be considered complete if you met only the core objectives
  * timetable: include breaks for exams and holidays
  * apply the things you learn in Project Management
  * Spend time on "impressive" things!

## Notes:
  * usually 8h/week
  * deadline next Thu 12th October
* Small introduction:
  - What an FPGA is
  - imagine this is reviewed by someone from CS
  - introduce the problem, after introducing the big "FPGA" subject
* Objectives
  - must, might, could
* Project Management
  - gantt chart: divide project by weeks
  - the idea is to show all the steps
* Literature review
  - find works related to my project
  - when you reference any project/paper/etc. write a paragraph about outcomes, then compare the works in columns
  - all figures need reference
* Do research now, as it will all probably be useful for the final report
