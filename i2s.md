I2S (Inter-IC Sound) a serial link designed especially for transmitting digital audio data.

The I²S bus separates clock and serial data signals, resulting in simpler receivers than those required for asynchronous communications systems that need to recover the clock from the data stream.
This standard was introduced in 1986 by Philips Semiconductor (https://web.archive.org/web/20070102004400/http://www.nxp.com/acrobat_download/various/I2SBUS.pdf) and was first revised June 5, 1996. The standard was last revised on February 17, 2022 and updated terms master and slave to controller and target.(https://www.nxp.com/docs/en/user-manual/UM11732.pdf)

### Configuration

As shown in Figure 1, the bus has three lines (each of them of size 1-bit):
- Continuous Serial Clock (SCK);
- Word Select (WS);
- Serial Data (SD);
Where SCK and WS signlas are generated by the controller device.

#### 1. Serial Data
- transmitted in two’s complement with the MSB first. The MSB is transmitted first because the transmitter and receiver may have different word lengths.
- the MSB has a fixed position, whereas the position of the LSB depends on the word length
  - When the system word length is greater than the transmitter word length, the word is truncated
