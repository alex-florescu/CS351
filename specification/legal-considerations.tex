Testing will be performed in a private environment, and the presentation will only be available to the Department of Computer Science and other staff members within the University of Warwick. The SystemVerilog system will not be published, and no data will be collected for the development of this project. Hence, there are no legal, social, ethical, or professional issues to be considered.
