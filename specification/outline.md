# CS351 FPGA Guitar/Bass Effects Processor

## 1. Problem Statement
  * What is an FPGA?
    - Field Programmable Gate Array - programmable hardware
    - Xilinx definition: https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/fpga/what-is-an-fpga.html
      - Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are semiconductor devices that are based around a matrix of configurable logic blocks (CLBs) connected via programmable interconnects. FPGAs can be reprogrammed to desired application or functionality requirements after manufacturing. This feature distinguishes FPGAs from Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs), which are custom manufactured for specific design tasks. Although one-time programmable (OTP) FPGAs are available, the dominant types are SRAM based which can be reprogrammed as the design evolves.

According to statistics gathered by the guitar manufacturing company Fender, the number of people who know how to play the guitar or have attempted playing it is estimated to 712 million. ( https://www.guitarchalk.com/how-many-guitar-players/#:~:text=Estimated%20number%20of%20guitar%20players,percent%20of%20the%20world's%20population. )
One of the main approaches to learning how to play an instrument is reproducing several pieces of music, preferably of increasing difficulty. In the attempt of recreating a specific sound, audio effects provide noticeable difference.
The common procedure of adding audio effects to your guitar is by either purchasing _pedals_, hardware devices that are pipelined and connected in between the guitar and the amplifier, or by purchasing software that would replicate the _pedals_ and connecting the guitar to a computer through a separate audio interface.
  * Problem
    - Desired outcomes of playing an instrument: being able to reproduce your favourite pieces of music
    - We need to be able to add effects. So far this is commonly done either through hardware (separate or combined effects pedals), or through software (interface + a software that allows you to obtain the desired tone)
  * Cause
    - Effect pedals are often non-flexible and expensive
    - Software requires a larger set up and usually a laptop
  * Solution
    - Implementing effects on an FPGA kit
  * Impact
    - adds more physical mobility: does not require a large set-up
    - Accessible price (under Â£500 excluding cost of code development)
    - can be updated and improved
   
## 2. Objectives
The overall objective of the project is to design a series of mono audio effects that are commonly used for guitars, and implement them in SystemVerilog to produce an audio effects processor on an FPGA board.
  * Must have
    - Bypass option: permitting the sound to pass through the system with no alterations
    - Delay effect: Adding a delayed copy of the input sound on top of the input sound
    - Distortion effect: Outputting a distorted version of the input sound
  * Should have
    - Reverb effect: Adding multiple slightly-delayed and lowered copies of the sound on top of the input sound
  * Could have
    - Noise cancellation effect: removing an unwanted sound of a certain frequency from the input sound
    - Tuner: leds on the board could provide information to help tune the guitar

## 3. Methodology
 * Development methodology
   - To enable future objective re-prioritisation, an Agile methodology is suitable
   - For each audio effect/filter we can imagine a cycle consisting of
      1. research
      2. intial implementation
      3. reflection on potential changes
      4. final implementation
      5. testing
 * Code/version management methodology
   - use of GitHub for Version control and parallel documentation development

## 4. Timetable

Tasks interrupted by Holidays or other priorities have been given a longer duration
## 5. Risks & Resources
### Potential Risks
In order to prevent unexpected setbacks on the development of the product, a set of possible risks has been considered:
 - The PC used for developing the audio system breaks and the progress is lost
    * Use a cloud storage method for both code base and documentation, such as GitHub to prevent any data loss
    * Do not leave the PC unsupervised in public areas
  
 - The FPGA kit breaks and development is stalled
    * Avoid unnecesarry transportation of the kit
    * Only use the kit in a trusted and safe environment
    * Use simulation testbenches as the main method of verification. Only perform hardware testing after simulations are denoted successful

 - Student illness or inability to work
    * Respect a healthy schedule and a maintain an adequate balance of rest and time dedicated to work.
    * Consider ergonomic recomendations, such as correct posture or appropriate room lighting.
    * Divide project objectives into mandatory and optional categories, to allow deprioritisation of goals in the case of an unfortunate event.

### Resources
- The system will be created in the SystemVerilog language. Code will be developed using Visual Studio Code and Xilinx Vivado. The latter will also be used to simulations and testbench creation.
- The FPGA board that will be used is a *Xilinx Zybo Z7-20*
- The music equipment used are
   * Harley Benton JB-20 Bass Guitar
   * Fender Rumble 40 Amplifier
   * 6.35mm Jack cables and 6.35mm Jack to 3.5mm Jack adapters 

## 6. Legal, Social, Ethical and Professional Issues & Considerations
Testing will be performed in a private environment, and the presentation will only be available to the Department Computer Science and other staff members within the University of Warwick. The SystemVerilog system will not be published and no data will be collected for the development of this project. Hence there are no legal, social, ethical or professional issues to be considered.
